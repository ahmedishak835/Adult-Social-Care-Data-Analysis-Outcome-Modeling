# Adult-Social-Care-Data-Analysis-Outcome-Modeling
This project explores a complex Adult Social Care dataset (inspired by UK Local Authority frameworks) to analyze the relationship between regional deprivation, care costs, and service user outcomes. The goal was to determine if specific interventions—such as the presence of a carer—directly correlate with improved independence for residents.
